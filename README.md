# This project implements a weather monitoring system by measuring temperature and pressure of the given environment on a daily basis to keep a track of the upcoming weather conditions and help forecasting it via news to the public. This system will use an LM35 temperature sensor and also a pressure sensor to measure temperature and pressure of the surrounding environment continuously.
# The main control unit of this device is an ARM based microcontroller called the STM32.A Liquid Crystalline Display (LCD) is used for displaying the values of the weather forecast so that the user can have a clear view on the temperature and pressure. 
Also, Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) communication protocol is implemented to the device and the values can be seen on a separate terminal by the controller of the device to have a much clear view of the forecast. 
The proposed system will help in determining the weather forecast in the upcoming days, weeks, months or years and also determine the condition of the weather and let the public know about this so that they can plan their day. For e.g.: if the weather forecast shows it will probably rain during the evening 4pm, then those people can carry an umbrella to keep themselves dry during the rain.
